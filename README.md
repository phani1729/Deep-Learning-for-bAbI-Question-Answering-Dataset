# Deep-Learning-for-bAbI-Question-Answering-Dataset
Build a Deep Learning memory network for bAbI Question-Answering Dataset 

 The main moto of building this model is to increase the reasoning power of the neural network, thatâ€™s why our model can also be called as RAM (Reasoning, Attention Memory) model.
 
  The dataset consists of a story with a series of questions and an answer. We have to build a model such that it has reason with the given questions and predict the correct answer.
  
 The model was built using keras coding interface. For building model, we have used 3 embedding layers named Memory embedding, Question embedding, controller embedding and an attention layer.
 
 After training the model with 200 epochs and using Adam optimizer, we have achieved Validation accuracy of 96.4%.
